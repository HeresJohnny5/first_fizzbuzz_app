# First FizzBuzz App

This was my first attempt at creating a simple app using the FizzBuzz algorithm:

1. Take the user's name
2. Provide details on how FizzBuzz works and ask the user to input a number
3. A results page will provide feedback based upon what number the user inputed
	* Number divisible by 3 and 5
	* Number divisible by only 3
	* Number divisible by only 5
	* Number is not divisible by 3, 5, and/or 3 and 5

## Run fizzbuzz_app.rb to run the app

If you don't have *sinatra-reloader gem* please hash out **require 'sinatra/reloader' if development?** on app.rb
