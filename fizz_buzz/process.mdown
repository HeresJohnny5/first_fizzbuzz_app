I created a folder hierarchy:
	Projects(f)
		mined_minds_fizz_buzz.rb
		test.rb
		process.mdown
		views(f)

I created a github repository called Projects(f), fizz_buzz(f)

Before working on the app itself, I started writing tests:
	My first confirmed that mined_minds_fizz_buzz.rb and test.rb are functioning correctly.

****Tests:
	3 runs/3 assertions
		test_divisible_by_three_returns_string_mined
		test_divisible_by_nine_returns_string_mined
		test_divisible_by_three_hundred_returns_string_mined
	* Note *
		I created a conditional statement using a modulus operator:
			if number % 3 == 0
				"Mined"
			else
				number
			end

	6 runs/6 assertions
		test_divisible_by_five_returns_string_minds
		test_divisible_by_ten_returns_string_minds
		test_divisible_by_five_hundred_returns_string_minds
	* Note *
		Using the previously mentioned conditional statement I extended the code using a elsif:
			elsif number % 5 == 0
				"Minds"
			else
				number
			end
	* Note *
		Although the code functions correctly I see a issue; test 3 returns string "Mined" as it's divisible by 3, however it's also divisible by 5.
